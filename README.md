# ReactRefresh
Repository for the Section 2 "Rect Refresh" of the Udemy Course "Next.js &amp; React - The Complete Guide (incl. Two Paths!)" by Maximilan Schwarzmüller.

## Notes
Not every Module or Project is done the same way as shown in the tutorial videos of the course by Maximilan Schwarzmüller. I did not use Firebase as a Backend. I used a globally installed ( Json-Server ) [https://github.com/typicode/json-server] by typicode. You can find the used fake db fake.json in the folder "db" at root level.
