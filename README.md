# ReactUdemyTutorials
Repository for the React Refreshmodule of Maximilan Schwarzmüller on Udemy. The Course is called "Next.js &amp; React - The Complete Guide (incl. Two Paths!)"

##Notes
Not every Module or Project is done the same way as shown in the tutorial videos of the course by Maximilan Schwarzmüller. I did not use Firebase as a Backend. I used a globally installed (Json-Server)[https://github.com/typicode/json-server] by typicode. You can find the used fake db fake.db in the folder "db" at root level.
